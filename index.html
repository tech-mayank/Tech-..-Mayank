            Hi..
            First of all thank you for reading about me.
            I am Mayank Singhal and I'm a pre-final year student of B.Tech,CSE from IIT Jammu. I've always been passionate about finding newer ways 
            of helping the society through technology. I've started doing coding right from my school days and have a huge interest in problem solving 
            and how to solve the things using different technologies. I've made my hands dirty to a great extent in <b>Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, 
            Software Development and Computer Vision</b> and to some extent in <b>Website and Android development</b>. Apart from that I've also completed few internships in Data 
            Science and Computer Vision. In my recent internship at Optum Global Solutions (By United Health Group) I worked as a software developer. Apart from that I'm also <b>doing research 
            in Geo Tagged Artificial and Real Spatial Databases, Optimization of GTP and GNN Queries on such databases by location based service providers</b> etc. I've also submitted a research 
            paper in one of the <b>renowned International Conference of Big Data</b>, and others are in the line.
