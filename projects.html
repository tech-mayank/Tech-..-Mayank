            <p class="mb-4">This is simple web application for managing your day-to-day to-do's. The frontend of the application has been 
              written using Angular CLI 10.0.6 whereas the database used is google' robust database "FIREBASE". The finel application is 
              deployed using ngh pages on github. Click here to see the application click<a href="https://tech-mayank.github.io/Angular-Firebase-Todo-App/">here</a>

            <center><h4 class="tm-page-title">AI Based Covid-19 Solution Compliance</h4></center>
            <p class="mb-4">Covid-19 is one of the major pandemic that has hit the manking in its strongest form. And following 
              the guidelines is the only vaccine. But I've realized that monitoring such guidelines manually is a tough task and
              therefore I have built an AI Based Product which serves as solution for Covid-19 Pandemic Situation.
              This is a robust AI based cross platform software which could withstand strong and weak light and could give accurate results 
              even in extreme temperature and humidity. The software works in a number of steps. The first step is the screening for 
              Temperature followed by Conjunctivitis(or any kind of redness in the eyes), the second is for mask detection and 
              third checks for Surveillance for Maintaining Social Distancing. For more information click <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J3etXndVzBno0fxjlRQ-eer780d3PQX0rQuPm3_OSME/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

          <center><h4 class="tm-page-title">Image Classification Application</h4></center>
          <p class="mb-4">This Project is based on Image Classification Application build on Flask Web FrameWork. You just have to upload 
              the image and it will detect the class of the object in the image. Apart from objects, it will even predict the breed of your dog. 
              It is the Pure DL Application in Which I have used Convolutional Neural Networks to train my model. Give it a Try.

          <p class="mb-4">
            This Application is based on Sentiment Analysis. Most of the times the mess secy does not find time to crosscheck every review provided 
            by the students. So, to reduce that workload here is this application. This application is build on Django Web Framework. You just upload
            your review and it will classify it as good, funny or bad. All the analysis of the reviews will be shown to the admin of the portal and 
            accordingly he/she will make the improvements.  
          </p>
