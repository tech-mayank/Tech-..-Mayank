          </center>
          <p class="mb-4"> It's a full fledge and complete solution for attendance managemnet not just for students but for an entire Institute. 
            The attendance are recorded based on the facial features and get store in the databases based on the course, the particular student is attending. Not just 
            students but the product also maintains the attendance of all the faculties and staff too. Basically the aim of this product was to use 
            facial recognition as a medium of capturing the attendance and thereby making the systems contactless.

            application has been
            written using Angular CLI 10.0.6 whereas the database used is google' robust database "FIREBASE". The finel

          </center>
          <p class="mb-4">Covid-19 is one of the major pandemic that has hit the manking in its strongest form. And
            following
            the guidelines is the only vaccine. But I've realized that monitoring such guidelines manually is a tough
            task and
            therefore I have built an AI Based Product which serves as solution for Covid-19 Pandemic Situation.
            This is a robust AI based cross platform software which could withstand strong and weak light and could give
            accurate results
            even in extreme temperature and humidity. The software works in a number of steps. The first step is the
            screening for
            Temperature followed by Conjunctivitis(or any kind of redness in the eyes), the second is for mask detection
            and
            third checks for Surveillance for Maintaining Social Distancing. For more information click <a

          <p class="mb-4">This Project is based on Image Classification Application build on Flask Web FrameWork. You
            just have to upload
            the image and it will detect the class of the object in the image. Apart from objects, it will even predict
            the breed of your dog.
            It is the Pure DL Application in Which I have used Convolutional Neural Networks to train my model.

          </center>
          <p class="mb-4">
            This Application is based on Sentiment Analysis. Most of the times the mess secy does not find time to
            crosscheck every review provided
            by the students. So, to reduce that workload here is this application. This application is build on Django
            Web Framework. You just upload
            your review and it will classify it as good, funny or bad. All the analysis of the reviews will be shown to
            the admin of the portal and
            accordingly he/she will make the improvements.

          <p class="mb-4">This was my First Project in Which I have tried my hands both on Frontend and Backend. This is
            a fully responsive portal
